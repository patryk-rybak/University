# Machine Learning

This repository contains Machine Learning assignments that focus on designing data-driven programs. It delves into ML approaches, among others, such as Decision Trees, Boosted Trees, Random Forests, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It covers concepts of trainable models, model selection, estimating model performance, and discriminative versus generative training. It introduces key classification and regression algorithms, and provides hands-on experience with Python tools like numpy, pandas, and sklearn.
