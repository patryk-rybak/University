# Artificial Intelligence

This repository explores various topics related to Artificial Intelligence, such as modeling reality, state space search (e.g., A* algorithm), constraint solving (e.g., AC-3), game strategies (e.g., minimax algorithm, alpha-beta pruning, Monte Carlo Tree Search), game theory, propositional logic, uncertainty modeling (e.g., Markov decision processes), and reinforcement learning.

Dualers and validators are not mine.
